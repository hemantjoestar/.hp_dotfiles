== Vyper ==
- insert compiler version
  - poor solution
    - null fix
    - append vs put
  - needs
    - delete compiler version line if already exists
    - competent regex required if able to handle multiple cases ex. `*commit, *.*. etc`
    - error message if no viper compiler found from system
